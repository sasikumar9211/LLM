        "Prepare the dataset in the desired format - Concatenate the original DataFrame 'data' with a new DataFrame created by normalizing JSON data. - The 'data['llama_response_parsed']' column is assumed to contain JSON data that needs to be flattened and normalized. - 'pd.json_normalize' is a pandas function used to normalize semi-structured JSON data into a flat DataFrame. In this case, it's applied to the 'llama_response_parsed' column, which presumably contains JSON data. - The result of 'pd.json_normalize' is a DataFrame where the JSON data is flattened and each element becomes a separate column. - The 'axis=1' parameter specifies that the concatenation should be done horizontally, i.e., the new columns from normalization will be added as new columns in the 'data' DataFrame. - After this operation, the 'data' DataFrame will contain the original columns along with the additional columns generated by normalizing the JSON data from the 'llama_response_parsed - example - data = pd.concat([data, pd.json_normalize(data['llama_response_parsed'])], axis=1) Drop specific columns which are not needed from the DataFrame 'data' Keep the columns that are mentioned in the sample output"

        "   - On checking the above response, Llama 2 13 b model is good in understanding the complaints context and issues given by the users. It is capable of spliting the given context into Categories, assigning the tags for the user complaints, urgency/priority to solve the issue with proper and realistic ETA's.\n",
        "   - Model is also capable of providing the first line response based on the sentiment provided in the ticket.\n",
        "   -  On using the Zero shot prompt there are few responses are not in the asked format.\n",
        "   - But when we have given a few samples as input to the model, it is capable of replying in the requested format.\n",
        "   - Model is keen in analysing the context and asking for more information about the issue.\n",
        "   - This model can be itegrate with streamlit as a reponsive chat bot to user and also can efficiently do the support ticket categorization. Based on the category and ticket priority we can automate the ticket to assign to different Level of engineers to solve the issues with proactiveness and helps in Engineering resource management.\n",
        "   - On a General note,The Llama 2 model, as we can see, is able to produce high-quality outputs that would be considered on par with the quality of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, highlighting the progress that open-source LLMs have been able to make.\n"
